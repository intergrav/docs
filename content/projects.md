I work on various projects in my spare time, such as Minecraft modpacks and other things. My modpacks are meant to be modular, lightweight, simple, and easy to build from to make your own. Here's my main projects:

## [Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline) - leading performance modpack for Minecraft

My most popular project - Adrenaline - is a performance modpack for both Fabric and Quilt mod loaders, ranging from Minecraft 1.16 to latest versions. It utilizes various mods to optimize the game to it's fullest potential, giving massive boosts in framerates. It also has a few other optimizations, such as faster world loading and generation, much faster boot times, and more. The pack is updated about weekly, depending on how busy I am.

If you would like to see more about it, see the Modrinth page for [Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline). You can also see the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/intergrav/Adrenaline).

You can download the pack using a third party launcher such as Prism Launcher. Here is [Modrinth's official documentation](https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/modpacks/playing_modpacks/) for doing this.

## [Additive](https://modrinth.com/modpack/additive) - fast OptiFine alternative for modern loaders

Another popular project of mine is Additive, an OptiFine alternative modpack for Minecraft that is built from Adrenaline. This means you get all of the same optimizations as above, along with nearly-full OptiFine parity. You can install most resource packs that utilize OptiFine/MCPatcher features, get a cape or see other OptiFine capes, use shaders with Iris, and much more.

If you would like to see more about it, see the Modrinth page for [Additive](https://modrinth.com/modpack/additive). You can also see the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/intergrav/Additive).

Like Adrenaline, you can download the pack [using a third party launcher](https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/modpacks/playing_modpacks/) such as Prism Launcher.

## [Devin's Badges](https://intergrav.github.io/devins-badges-docs/) - consistent badges for many services

While not currently being maintained as much as it used to be, Devin's Badges is my large collection of neatly-designed badges for various services, such as GitHub or Discord. [Here's a preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intergrav/devins-badges/v3/assets/cozy/social/discord-singular_64h.png) of one of the badges.

Here is the [website](https://intergrav.github.io/devins-badges-docs/) and the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges).

Here are my side projects, which I don't update as often.

## [Adrenaserver](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaserver) - heavily optimize Fabric and Quilt servers

Adrenaserver is like Adrenaline, but instead of being for clients, it's designed to optimize servers! It's generally targeted for use on small to medium sized servers. It has a pretty similar mod list to Adrenaline, with many client-side mods removed for obvious reasons. It can offer a significant decrease in MSPT and can keep the server's TPS at a stable 20 even with some somewhat-heavy load.

See the [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaserver) page for more information and installation instructions. Want to contribute? See the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/intergrav/Adrenaserver).

## [Hammer](https://modrinth.com/modpack/hammer) - performance modpack for Forge

Hammer is like Adrenaline, but made for the Forge mod loader instead of Fabric and Quilt. Generally, it's recommended to use Adrenaline instead for more stability, compatibility, much faster updates, and more optimization, but I made this if anyone really needs it.

If you would like to see more about it, see the Modrinth page for [Hammer](https://modrinth.com/modpack/hammer). You can also see the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/intergrav/Hammer).

You can download the pack [using a third party launcher](https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/modpacks/playing_modpacks/) such as Prism Launcher.
