Hi! My name is Devin. I do music, visual design, and programming sometimes. I am currently working on an open-source badge library and four Minecraft modpacks. For more information about me, see my [GitHub](https://github.com/intergrav) page.

This website contains my blog posts. If you would like to contribute to them or if you find issues, feel free to see the [repository](https://github.com/intergrav/intergrav.github.io).
