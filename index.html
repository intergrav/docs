    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>My name is Devin, but I'm also known as devin_real or intergrav. I enjoy UI/UX design, programming, music, and making useful things for free. I love open-source software and Linux. I currently maintain some <a href="https://modrinth.com/organization/skywardmc">Minecraft modpacks</a> and a large library of <a href="https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges">carefully designed badges</a>. This site was easily made with the help of <a href="https://github.com/xz/new.css">new.css</a>.</p>

    <h1>Projects</h1>

    <p>If you need to contact me personally, feel free to send me an <a href="mailto:intergrav@proton.me">email</a>. I sometimes read them. I'm also on <a href="https://floss.social/@intergrav">Mastodon</a>, in which I'll probably respond faster there. I am not looking for hire.</p>
